# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Alphabet Soup’s business team, wants to predict where to make investments using machine learning and neural networks

# Purpose
Using the next features, help Alphabet Soup´s business team to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The dataset contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

So, we need to:
**Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model**
**Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model**
**Optimize the Model**
